** we save the string into line up to the length found. Then we readjust the
** stored data (**s) by creating a temporary string that stored the rest of data
** after the newline. We free the stored data to update it to the current
** address because we already append a line from it. This is done by freeing *s
** and setting it equal to the temporary string that stored the remaining data.
** At any point when we reach the end of the file, we free the memory used to
** track our location in *s because it is not needed anymore.

** The get_next_line function reads a file and returns the line ending with a

** When get_next_line is first called, we check to see if our static variable
** **s is empty. If it is, we allocate memory for it using our buff string.
** In the loop, we will continue to read more of the line and join them together
** using a temporary string. This temporary string will replace the stored data
** each iteration so that we can keep track of how much is read and delete
** the previous stored data. This is needed because we are only reading so many
** n-bytes at a time decided by our BUFF_SIZE. If we read at each iteration
** without freeing memory, then we would have memory leaks. The loop breaks when
** a newline is encountered. Finally, we call output function to check what
** should be returned.
